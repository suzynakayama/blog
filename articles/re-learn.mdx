    If you don't use your knowledge, after a while you start to forget it.

Yes, that is a truth I have lived with for my whole life. But how long it takes for us to forget and have to re-learn it?

Research shows that within 1 hour, people will have forgotten an average of 50 percent of the new information. Within 24 hours, they have forgotten an average of 70 percent of new information, and within a week, forgetting claims an average of 90 percent of it. - _<a href="https://learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/1379/brain-science-the-forgetting-curvethe-dirty-secret-of-corporate-training#:~:text=Research%20on%20the%20forgetting%20curve,of%2090%20percent%20of%20it.">Art Kohn</a>_

But that is not the knowledge we are talking about here. If a person studies a subject for a great time span, this person should retain most of the information for a considerable amount of time. This will vary from person to person, and definitely depend on the usage of that information.

Why am I writing about all this?

Well, if you are my friend, you know I have a **really bad memory**. I love to learn different subjects, but I don't always use that knowledge on my daily life, and therefore I end up forgetting about all of them. For example:
_I have studied Law for 8+ years, worked with it for more than 5 years and now I forgot 90% of it. I have studied french for 6+ years and now I can only remember a few phrases and words._

I am here, writing this article, to let you know it is üÜó to forget things. It is üÜó to have to read all over again about something that you have already studied.

I started this journey in technology loving every single thing about CSS. I was the only student of my bootcamp that loved CSS, that knew by heart how to do several different stylings with just a couple of lines.

However, when I started working, I barely used CSS, I started working on the backend and, unfortunately, I forgot most things related to CSS. I decided to do a CSS course in order to remember, but that's when I realized I was not only remembering, I was **re-learning**. In this course I learned a lot of things all over again, and I have also learned new tricks. ü§ì

Even though forgetting is a bummer and makes us do double work, it also brings us more knowledge and help us retain the "re-learned" subject. So don't feel bad about forgetting things you have learned, look at it as an opportunity to improve. And if all fails, remember, I do have a worser memory than you, so you are already a winner! üèÜ

And don't forget, like all things in life, learning is a lifelong path.

**See ya!** üëã
