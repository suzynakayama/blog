Everyone knows that looking for a job is not an easy thing to do. Now imagine this scenario:

> You go through 3 intense months of coding bootcamp, you have everything planned to get a job in max 6 months, you are happy and your life is beautiful.

Yeah, that was my ideal scenario too. However, Covid-19!

If you read my [first article](59-days), you will know how happy and hopeful I was when I finished my Bootcamp.

Right after the Bootcamp, I had a couple of interviews and started studying algorithms and data structures (big O: [part1](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/oh-big-o-part-1-490f4c52afe), [part2](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/oh-big-o-part-2-3017fb7c8041), [part3](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/oh-big-o-part-3-5e3ccee2097)), a little more about react, redux, python, flask, but the world had stopped. Everyone was losing their jobs, no companies were hiring juniors and all I could do was applying and studying.

I had a few interviews, I even interviewed for Google! I was so happy with this opportunity, but I was definitely not ready yet. I did my best, but it wasn’t supposed to be. So, I kept studying.

There were days that I felt hopeless, and I felt really bad whenever I didn’t want to study, but I just couldn’t stop. Every time I thought about taking the day off, I felt like I was giving up, that I was not fit, that I was never going to get it. (I hate you, imposter syndrome!) 😢

Little did I know that I was burying myself more and more in this depressive state, with all the self-doubts, while everyone around me was cheering on me, but I couldn’t see it.

One day, in one of the weekly chats with our career coach, he said that it’s ok to take it slowly, that it’s ok to take the day off, that each person has their own pace, and that finally clicked for me! (btw, thank you, George! 🙏)

After that, I was able to breathe again and even though I still had highs and lows, I didn’t felt bad about taking a day off. I knew everything would be ok and whenever my time arrives, I would get that one yes.

Now, there are several ways to job search. I’m going to share 2 here:

1. Find the company you want to work for and do everything you can to get the job. Study absolutely everything about the company, make contacts, and if it doesn’t work on the first try, don’t give up!

2. Apply to everything that fits your profile. You can, and should, have a list with the ones you like the most, but keep applying to all the opportunities you find. As someone told me once, job searching is a numbers game.

With everything that was happening, I decided to go for the second way…

> I applied to 573 jobs, got 145 mixed answers, interviewed for 39 companies, and got 2 yes.

Yes, I got 2 yes…from the SAME company! One in July, but at that time something else happened and they couldn’t continue with the hiring process. And another one in September, they were able to hire again and contacted me. After my first lot of interviews and learning more about the company and the team, I realized I really wanted to work at this company, they have a great team, great leadership, and a great environment, so you can imagine my happiness when I got the good news, right?! 🤩

Things I learned during this rollercoaster and that I think are important to share:

1. Don’t compare yourself to others, each person has their own pace 🚶‍♀️🏃‍♀️

2. If you didn’t find a job yet, it’s because it was not supposed to be, when it’s your time, it will happen 🕓

3. Try to keep learning and creating projects to improve and show your knowledge 👩‍💻

4. Be active on LinkedIn — this one is VERY important! Share your projects, comment on interesting things, share your knowledge 👩‍🏫

5. If you are having a ‘low’ day, don’t force yourself, take the day off and come back tomorrow refreshed 🧘

6. Don’t feel bad about taking a break and be kind to yourself! ❤️

7. Don’t overthink. If things look too complicated, just break in small/achievable tasks. 🤹

Looking for a job is like going on a rollercoaster, you are going to have highs and lows. Some days you will feel that you can conquer the world, while others you might just want to stay in bed under the duvet. Listen to your body and mind, believe in yourself, and keep pushing! I know you can do it! 💪
